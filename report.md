Software Design Lab 1 

In this lab my objective is to show that I know how to work with Git and  GitHub Pages. This was done by creating branches, managing branches, making commits and pushing changes to my remote repository.

This was done by following the steps I was given.

Initialising the about me repo.
Making commits containing the files: student-info, report as well as the index file.
Branching by creating feature/student-details branch.
Merging and Pulling by merging the branch I created as well as it's changes into main branch.
Deploying the website using GitHub pages.
